# NachoDB ðŸ§€
A simple sqlite-like database written in C

---

# Why, though?

To practice C after a 8 year hiatus, I'm building small projects in the language. It's a horrible data store but serves to improve my grasp on C.

<br />
Here's the NachoDB prompt:

```
nacho > 
```

Here are some useful commands:

1. `.insert`
2. `.select`
3. `.tables`
4. `.delete`
5. `.exit`
