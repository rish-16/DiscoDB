# NachoDB ðŸ§€
A simple sqlite-like database written in C

---

# Why, though?

To practice C after a 8 year hiatus, I'm building small projects in the language. It's a rough and dirty data store but serves to improve my grasp on C. 
<br />
<br />
Here's the NachoDB prompt:

```
nacho > 
```

NachoDB has a single table with a fixed schema:

| ID | Name       | Email            |
|----|------------|------------------|
| 0  | John Doe   | jdoe@gmail.com   |
| 1  | Dave Smith | dsmith@gmail.com |

<br />

Here are some useful commands:

1. `insert`
2. `select`
3. `delete`
4. `.exit`
